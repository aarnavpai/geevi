      <description>Probabilistic Graphical Models refers to concise representations of probability distributions using graphs.
It also studies efficient algorithms for sampling distrubtions represented in such form. Sampling might need to be done from
the joint probability distribution, the marinals or even conditional distributions. Other algoritmic questions involve computing
the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE), Maximum Aposteriori Estimate (MAP) etc. This topic has deep connections and applications to various
fields including Theoretical Computer Science, Machine Learning, Statistical Physics, Bioinformatics etc.</description>

      <description>This course is intended to familiarize the students with the types of mathematical reasoning found in theoretical research on computing and communications. The course contains a broad set of intermediate and advanced level topics in Algebra, Combinatorics, Probability and Graph Theory.
Goal: By the end of the course, students should be able to read and understand research papers with algebraic/combinatorial reasoning. They should should be able to write concise and clear proofs.</description>
