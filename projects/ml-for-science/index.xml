      <description>Recent years have witnessed utilization of modern machine learning approaches for predicting properties of material using available datasets. However, to identify potential candidates for material discovery, one has to systematically scan through a large chemical space and subsequently calculate the properties of all such samples. On the other hand, generative methods are capable of efficiently sampling the chemical space and can generate molecules/materials with desired properties. In this study, we report a deep learning based inorganic material generator (DING) framework consisting of a generator module and a predictor module.</description>
